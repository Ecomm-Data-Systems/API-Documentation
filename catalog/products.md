# Catalog::Products

This document covers how you can pull a list of products with filters and a single product that is simple, or advanced with variants.

> :bulb: IMPORTANT: The API delivers product with a ```published``` status. The admin tool allows an admin to create a product but to save it as a ```draft```. If you are not seeing a product you expect to see, double check the publish status in the admin.
